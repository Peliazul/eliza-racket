Eliza for Racket
----------------

Forked from Chatter Bot framework for Guile.

Grab the code and load and run `eliza.rkt` in DrRacket, then
enter `(main)` to run.

Tests
-----

There are some unit tests in `bot-tests.rkt`

Bugs
----

There are some, probably because of my buggy translation
from the Guile version.

Examples...

you> weather
. . hash-ref: no value found for key
  key: 'weather



Let me know any that you find, I might fix them.
